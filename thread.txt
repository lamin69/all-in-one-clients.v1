go to this url : https://shellngn.com/ read all the documentations scrol all the website to get an idea about the fuctionalities of the services this wesite provides . after analyzing every this my project is to create a exactly an app that will be used with docke and provides the same services and has exactely the same layout of the graphics in this website . now tel me briefly if you can generate all codes to to ashieve this . if yes this is the files structure for this project i generate the complete codes one at the time and i will prompt you for the next code

To achieve your project goal of creating an app that replicates the services and layout of the provided website (https://shellngn.com/), I cannot directly generate all the code for you, but I can certainly guide you throughout the process by providing code snippets, explaining concepts, and offering recommendations based on your given file structure. I'll be happy to help you step by step in building your app using Docker.

When you're ready, I can start by helping you create a simple HTML file that mirrors the layout of the given website's homepage, followed by the necessary CSS and JavaScript files. I'm also well versed in server-side programming, so I can assist you with creating RESTful APIs, handling data, and managing the app backend using various frameworks and languages.

Once you provide me with a more detailed file structure, I'll help you create the components one at a time. Here is an example of an HTML file structure that I can help you with to start building your app:

Create an application that replicates Shellngn's services and layout as folloow :

Functionality to Implement
SSH, Telnet, SFTP, RDP, VNC Clients:

Web-based terminals with tabbed sessions.
File browser for SFTP with drag-and-drop upload/download and file editor.
Remote desktop access via RDP and VNC.
Device and Identity Management:

Organize servers into folders, assign icons, and configure settings.
Manage identities for easy credential updates.
Automation and UI Features:

Command snippets for SSH automation.
Single-click connections and tabbed interfaces.
Always up-to-date with no client-side installations.
Technology Stack
Frontend:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js for dynamic components).
WebSocket for real-time SSH/terminal sessions.
Libraries for terminal emulation (e.g., xterm.js).
Backend:

Node.js for server-side logic.
Docker for containerized deployment.
APIs to manage SSH, Telnet, SFTP, RDP, and VNC sessions.
Database:

MongoDB or PostgreSQL for storing user data, server configurations, and session logs.
Steps to Develop
Setup Docker Containers:

Create Docker images for the application services.
Implement Docker Compose to orchestrate multi-container setups.
Develop Frontend:

Build a responsive UI that matches Shellngn's layout using React.js.
Integrate terminal emulation using xterm.js.
Implement file browser and editor with drag-and-drop capabilities.
Develop Backend:

Implement WebSocket server for SSH sessions.
Create REST APIs for managing devices, identities, and file operations.
Set up authentication and authorization mechanisms.
Testing and Deployment:

Write unit and integration tests for all components.
Use CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
Deploy on cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure) for scalability.
Additional Resources
Documentation: Provide comprehensive documentation for both users and developers.
Support: Implement a support system for user queries and issues. now lets start with html code.

keep track of all the above steps , incase we encountre issues with building the app in docker . now lets proceed with next code , each time you provide a code mention its path in according to the above file strucrue
